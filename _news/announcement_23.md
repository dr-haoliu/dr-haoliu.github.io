We are delighted to kick off the first meeting of Data Science Lab for Fall 2024 semester at Montclair State University! 
-----------------------

Our lab attracted a diverse group of students, all eager to contribute to cutting-edge research at the intersection of data science and healthcare. 
The enthusiasm and collaborative spirit were palpable as attendees discussed the lab's ambitious research agenda and its potential to make significant contributions to the field.
The lab's research portfolio promises to push boundaries across several exciting domains. 
Projects will explore the intricate relationships within Social Determinants of Health (SoDH), aiming to uncover insights that could reshape public health strategies. 
The team will also delve into advanced medical image classification techniques, potentially revolutionizing diagnostic processes. 
Furthermore, the lab plans to harness the power of knowledge graphs to enhance healthcare ontologies, and investigate innovative applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical trial patient matching.
This blend of artificial intelligence, data analytics, and healthcare expertise positions Montclair State University at the forefront of data-driven medical research, with the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare processes.
