MSU Student Presents Research at Prestigious IEEE CHASE 2025 Conference

---------------------
I'm proud to share that my students Shibbir Ahmed Arif and Julia Sammartino successfully presented our research at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE 2025), held at the Yeshiva University Museum in Manhattan, New York.
Our two posters, titled "A Framework for Ranking The Clinical Trials with Large Language Model Prompting" and "LLM-Based Extraction of Fluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s
  Disease Knowledge Base" were accepted for the conference's competitive Poster & Demo session.
