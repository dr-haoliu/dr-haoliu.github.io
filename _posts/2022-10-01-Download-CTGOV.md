## Downloading All Study Record Content for Analysis
A single zip file containing all study records available on ClinicalTrials.gov (that is, all registration information as well as any available results information for all study records) in XML format is available here:

To download the zip file containing all public data, enter the following URL into your browser:

https://clinicaltrials.gov/AllPublicXML.zip

Note: This is a very large file. It will likely take several minutes to download the entire zip file. Additionally, many receiving systems may subject the zip file to automatic security/virus scanning. This scanning may take several additional minutes to complete before the zip file is ready for use. Please be patient.

The zip file contains multiple directories subdividing the large number of files into more manageable quantities. A top level "Contents.txt" file contains information about the number of study records and the date the studies were published.
