I am a Postdoc Research Scientist at Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University in New York.

Previously, I was a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), co-advised by Yehoshua Perl and James Geller. My PhD research focused on developing machine learning algorithms for biomedicla ontology engineering, mainly focused on ontology enrichment and quality assurance. 
I am also passionate about applying machine/deep learning methods in clinical research.

Before I joined NJIT, I graduated with an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, NY. I obtained my bachelor degree from New York Institute of Technology, NY.
